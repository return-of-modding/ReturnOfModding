Return Of Modding is a modding plugin / framework for Risk of Rain Returns.

(A game made with GameMaker 2023.6 ultimately transpiled from GML to C++ with the GameMaker YYC compiler)

It's using [ReturnOfModding](https://github.com/xiaoxiao921/ReturnOfModdingBase) as a base. You can check its README for more information on how it works.

## Mod Manager Installation

- [Follow the instructions here.](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#first-time-installing)

## Manual Installation

- Place the main ReturnOfModding file, called `version.dll`, next to the game executable called `Risk of Rain Returns.exe` inside the game folder.

- To uninstall the mod loader or revert to a vanilla experience without mods, you can simply rename or delete the `version.dll` file.
