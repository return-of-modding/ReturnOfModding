# Table: _ENV - Plugin Specific Global Table

Each mod/plugin have their own global table containing helpers, such as:
- Their own guid

- Path to their own folder inside `config`: Used for data that must persist between sessions that can be manipulated by the user.

- Path to their own folder inside `plugins_data`: Used for data that must persist between sessions but not be manipulated by the user.

- Path to their own folder inside `plugins`: Location of .lua, README, manifest.json files.

You can access other mods helpers through the `mods[OTHER_MOD_GUID]` table.

```lua
print(_ENV["!guid"])

     log.info(n)
end
